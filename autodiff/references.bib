 abstract = {Using graphs for representing computational processes, relative error propagation is described. It is shown how this relates to the condition of a problem and to the property of a process to be benign, i.e., to have only harmless effects of rounding errors. In particular, composition of processes is studied under these aspects. Several examples illustrate the theory.},
