# Machine Learning Reading Group

## Presentations

All presentations are built in `LaTeX Beamer` with the Metropolis theme. For
now, the slides have been hosted on `Slideshare`.

* The Magic of Auto Differentiation ([LaTeX](./autodiff/autodiff.tex) | [PDF](https://www.slideshare.net/SanyamKapoor4/the-magic-of-auto-differentiation))

* One-Shot Learning and Siamese Networks ([LaTeX](./siamese-networks/siamese-networks.tex) | PDF)

## Compile All

```
$ make all
```

This will find all tex files and builds the final presentations in the `dist`
folder.
